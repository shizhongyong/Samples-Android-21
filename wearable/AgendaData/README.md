Android AgendaData Sample
===================================

Syncs calendar events to your wearable at the press of a button, using the Wearable
DataApi to transmit data such as event time, description, and background image. The DataItems can be
deleted individually via an action on the event notifications, or all at once via a button on the
companion. When deleted using the notification action, a ConfirmationActivity is used to indicate
success or failure.
